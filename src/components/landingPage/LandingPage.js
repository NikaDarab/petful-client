        The adoption process works strictly on a "First-In, First-Out" basis.
        The FIFO is based on the animals that came to the shelter first. You can
        adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but you may only adopt the animal that
        came to the shelter first. In addition, people who want to adopt are
        also put in a Queue so they can adopt when it's their turn.
